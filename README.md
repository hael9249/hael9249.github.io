## Seal

![ADNU Seal](https://jhs.adnu.edu.ph/pluginfile.php/17661/mod_page/content/2/logopng.png)

At the center of the new Ateneo seal is the escutcheon of the family of St. Ignatius de Loyola, founder of the Society of Jesus. The shield is divided vertically into two. The right panel shows two wolves rampant on either side of a hanging cauldron. The design symbolizes the hospitality and generosity of the Loyola family. The left panel shows seven red bars on a field of gold, honoring the seven heroes of the family who distinguished themselves in the Battle of Beotibar in 1321. It symbolizes nobility and heroism. This shield is part of the seal of most Jesuit schools in the world with which the Ateneo shares a four-hundred-year-old tradition of Jesuit liberal education.

Immediately above the Loyola escutcheon is a blue crown of Mary, Mother of God. Mary, under the title of our Lady of Peñafrancia, is Ina of the Ateneo.

Arranged in a semi-circle under the Loyola shield are six blue stars representing the six provinces of the Bicol Region.

Over Mary’s crown shines the Sun, a symbol of Christ Our Lord. On its face is the seal of the Society of Jesus in calligraphic form; the first three letters in Greek (IHS) of the Holy Name of Jesus with the cross on top and the nails of his passion underneath. The sun’s rays shine over Mary’s crown, the Loyola shield, the six stars, and beyond. This symbolizes that for Mary, for the Ateneo, for Bicol, and the world, Christ is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.

Thus, our seal stands for Ateneo’s commitment to Christ through the patronage of Mary, by following her example. It is a commitment characterized by Ignatian generosity, nobility, and heroism, expressed as being a man or woman for others.

## History

---

Ateneo is derived from “Athens”, the ancient seat of learning.  Naga comes from the word narra or Philippine mahogany.  Naga City, a center of religion, culture, education, and economics, is popularly known as the “Maogmang Lugar.”

Ateneo de Naga University is one of the eleven schools in the Philippines run by the Philippine Province of the Society of Jesus members. The main campus is located northwest of the Metropolitan Cathedral, in the barangay of Bagumbayan Sur in Naga City. In SY 2003- 2004, the high school transferred to a new campus in Pacol, now known as Bonoan Campus, located on the slopes of Mt. Isarog, seven kilometers away from the main campus.  The other Jesuit schools in the Philippines are Manila, Cagayan de Oro, Davao, Zamboanga, Bukidnon, Cebu, San Juan, Nuvali, Iloilo, and Culion.

Msgr. Pedro P. Santos, 31st prelate and first Archbishop of Caceres, invited Fr. John Hurley, S.J., then the Superior of the Philippine Jesuit Missions, to build a Jesuit school for boys in Naga. On 2 May 1940, Ateneo de Naga was founded with Francis D. Burns, S.J., as its director, aided by six Jesuits.

Classes formally started in June 1940 at the building formerly used by the Camarines Sur Catholic Academy (now Naga Parochial School) with 650 elementary and high school students—meanwhile, Msgr. Santos initiated the construction of the Jesuit faculty house and the Ateneo school building with the now well-known four pillars. These buildings were intended to be turned over to the Jesuits on 15 December 1941. However, this plan was thwarted when the Pacific War broke out.
