Ateneo is derived from “Athens”, the ancient seat of learning.  Naga comes from the word narra or Philippine mahogany.  Naga City, a center of religion, culture, education, and economics, is popularly known as the “Maogmang Lugar.”

Ateneo de Naga University is one of the eleven schools in the Philippines run by the Philippine Province of the Society of Jesus members. The main campus is located northwest of the Metropolitan Cathedral, in the barangay of Bagumbayan Sur in Naga City. In SY 2003- 2004, the high school transferred to a new campus in Pacol, now known as Bonoan Campus, located on the slopes of Mt. Isarog, seven kilometers away from the main campus.  The other Jesuit schools in the Philippines are Manila, Cagayan de Oro, Davao, Zamboanga, Bukidnon, Cebu, San Juan, Nuvali, Iloilo, and Culion.

Msgr. Pedro P. Santos, 31st prelate and first Archbishop of Caceres, invited Fr. John Hurley, S.J., then the Superior of the Philippine Jesuit Missions, to build a Jesuit school for boys in Naga. On 2 May 1940, Ateneo de Naga was founded with Francis D. Burns, S.J., as its director, aided by six Jesuits.

Classes formally started in June 1940 at the building formerly used by the Camarines Sur Catholic Academy (now Naga Parochial School) with 650 elementary and high school students—meanwhile, Msgr. Santos initiated the construction of the Jesuit faculty house and the Ateneo school building with the now well-known four pillars. These buildings were intended to be turned over to the Jesuits on 15 December 1941. However, this plan was thwarted when the Pacific War broke out.
